Project Description - A one stop solution for room management in children's hospitals. Intended to integrate seamlessly with their systems,
our website allows doctors to denote when they enter and exit their rooms. Additionally, this allows for the ability to order food to the room
without the necessity of going through the nurses. With this tool, doctors can more easily be managed and information about when and where they
checked up on patients will allow the hospital to run more efficiently.
